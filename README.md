# ⏲ Intro
This is a visual, interactive depiction of the so-called "Watcher's Clock". 

Watcher's Clock is a metaphoric orrery-like clock that is one of the fictional widgets in a WIP sci-fi post-apocalypse story.

It uses Earth (with terminator), Moon, and a pin to represent the time and date in a year.
